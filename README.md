This is a simple discord bot nuker. It deletes all the channels and the roles that it can (the bot's role should be above the role to be deleted).
If you are asking yourself where you need to put your token, you need to put it in .env

Idk if you can run it on replit but yeah.
I don't care what you do with this. If your account gets disabled its ur fault
